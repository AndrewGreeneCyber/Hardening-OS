<h1>Applying OS Hardening</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project investigated a brute force attack that allowed a hacker to gain unauthorized access to the admin panel of yummyrecipesforme.com by exploiting a weak default password. The hacker injected malicious JavaScript code, prompting visitors to download a malware-laden file and redirecting them to a fake website. The protocols involved included DNS, TCP, and HTTP, with logs showing DNS requests, TCP handshakes, and HTTP communications. The attack led to increased HTTP traffic, degraded performance, and potential security risks. To prevent future attacks, recommendations include implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA), using strong passwords, applying account lockout mechanisms, and deploying a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious traffic.
